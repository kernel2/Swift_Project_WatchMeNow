# Project Swift and SwiftUI

## Mobile Application for platforme IOS

### WatchToMe :

Mobile application that talks about films, on an iOS-type mobile platform. Its purpose is to put into practice what has been seen during the lessons. 
We can thus look at the comments, ratings and impressions of other users, who have already seen this film, then allowing us to know if this film is worth watching or if it is better to choose another. At the same time it allows you to get closer to distant people in space-time. We can also see which movies are the most popular and which are the most viewed.
In this application we will use an API call named themoviedb.org, to transcribe it to a mobile application via SwiftUI
